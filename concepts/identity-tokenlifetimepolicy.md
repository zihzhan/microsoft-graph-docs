# Token lifetime policy (preview)

<!-- Suggest following similar file structure as identity-activitybasedtimeoutpolicy.md
-->

Specifies the lifetimes of tokens issued for various purposes. This kind of policy can be [assigned](/graph/api/policy-assign?view=graph-rest-beta) to applications and service principals. Lifetimes can be configured for four kinds of tokens: 

- **Access Token** - contains information about the identity and privileges associated with a user account that is used by clients to access protected resources like applications.
- **Refresh Token** - is obtained together with the access token when a user authenticates against Azure AD through a client to access a protected resource. Although this token is not revoked or left unused for more than the **MaxInactiveTime**, it can be used to obtain a new access/refresh token pair when the current access token expires.
- **ID Token** - functions like an access token, but is obtained via the browser.
- **Session Token** - functions like a refresh token, but obtained via the browser.

Access/Refresh token pairs are obtained during client authentication. ID/Session token pairs are obtained during browser authentication.

## Properties

The [policy](/graph/api/resources/policy?view=graph-rest-beta) resource contains a definition JSON property, that specifies the behavior for this type of policy. This JSON object must be converted to a string with escaped quotations before insertion into the **definition** property. The table below describes the properties in the **definition** for the token lifetime policy type.

>**Note:** All time durations in these properties are specified in the format "dd.hh:mm:ss". The maximum values for properties denoted in days are 1 second short of the denoted number of days. For example, the maxiumum value of 1 day is specified as "23:59:59".

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|AccessTokenLifetime|String|Controls how long both access and ID tokens are considered valid. The minimum value is 10 minutes; the maximum value is 1 day; the default value is 1 hour.|
|MaxInactiveTime|String|Controls how old a refresh token can be before a client can no longer use it to retrieve a new access/refresh token pair to access a resource. The minimum value is 10 minutes; the maximum value is 90 days; the default value is 14 days.|
|MaxAgeSingleFactor|String|Controls how long a user can continue to use refresh tokens to get new access/refresh token pairs after the last time they authenticated successfully with only a single factor. Because single-factor is considered less secure than multi-factor authentication, we recommend setting this policy to an equal or lesser value than **MultiFactorRefreshTokenMaxAge**. The minimum value is 10 minutes; the maximum value is until-revoked; the default value is 365 days or until-revoked.|
|MaxAgeMultiFactor|String|Controls how long a user can continue to use refresh tokens to get new access/refresh token pairs after the last time they authenticated successfully with multi-factor authentication. The minimum value is 10 minutes; the maximum value is until-revoked; the default value is 365 days or until-revoked.|
|MaxAgeSessionSingleFactor|String|Controls how long a user can continue to use session tokens to get new ID/session tokens after the last time they authenticated successfully with only a single factor. Because single-factor is considered less secure than multi-factor authentication, it is recommended that this policy is set to an equal or lesser value than **MultiFactorSessionTokenMaxAge**. The minimum value is 10 minutes; the maximum value is until-revoked; the default value is 365 days or until-revoked.|
|MaxAgeSessionMultiFactor|String|Controls how long a user can continue to use session tokens to get new ID/session tokens after the last time they authenticated successfully with multi-factors. The minimum value is 10 minutes; the maximum value is until-revoked; the default value is 365 days or until-revoked.|
|Version|Integer|Set value of 1. Required.|

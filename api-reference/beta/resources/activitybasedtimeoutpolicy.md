# activityBasedTimeoutPolicy policy definition

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A policy that enables you to configure idle timeout for web sessions for applications that support activity-based timeout functionality. Applications enforce automatic signout after a period of inactivity. This type of policy must be applied at the organization level.

## Properties

The [policy](policy.md) resource contains a definition JSON property that specifies the behavior for this type of policy. This JSON object must be converted to a string with escaped quotations before insertion into the **definition** property. The following table  describes the properties in the **definition** for the activity-based timeout policy type.

>**Note:** All time durations in these properties are specified in the following format: dd.hh:mm:ss.

The maximum values for properties denoted in days are 1 second short of the denoted number of days. For example, the maximum value of 1 day is specified as 23:59:59.

|ApplicationPolicies|Array|Collection of application policies.|
|ApplicationId|String|Application identifier the policy applies to. A value of "default" indicates the default value that applies to all applications that support activity-based timeout functionality but do not have application-specific overrides.
